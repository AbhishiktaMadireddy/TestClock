               Project: Program TestClock to test the behavior of Clock class.

B.	Description of the program
•	Program to test the behavior of a clock.
	A clock class is written for performing various operations.
        The variables are declared as hours, minutes and seconds.
        Three constructors and a default constructor are made.
        Various operations on the behaviour of the clock are included as instance methods
        like reset, calibrate,set time, toggleclock etc.
        The time is returned as string using toString() method.
        To test the behaviour of this clock class, a main TestClock is made
        which asks the user for the input and prints out the output.
        The switch case is used to allow the user to select the desired option.
        A try catch exception prints out when an incorrect input is given.
C.	Usage of program:
•	The main TestClock is run which prints out a variety of options for theuser to select.
        As per the option selected, the appropriate output is printed out.
D.	Examples:
Welcome to the clock testing program:
Commands :
--------
a=advance(increase time by one second)
c=calibrate(set to current time)
q=quit
r=reset(set hours, minutes,and second to zero)
s=set(allow user to set time)
t=toggle(switch from 24-hour clock to 12-hour clock,or vice-versa)

The time is now 00:00:00
Enter command(a,c,q,r,s,or t):c

The time is now 01:39:49p.m
Enter command(a,c,q,r,s,or t):a

The time is now 01:39:50p.m
Enter command(a,c,q,r,s,or t):r

The time is now 00:00:00
Enter command(a,c,q,r,s,or t):s
Enter hours: 21
Enter minutes: 9
Enter seconds: 5

The time is now 21:09:05
Enter command(a,c,q,r,s,or t):t

The time is now 09:09:05p.m
Enter command(a,c,q,r,s,or t):


Enter command(a,c,q,r,s,or t):s
Enter hours: 25
Input must be between 0 and 23; please try again.
Enter hours: -1
Input must be between 0 and 23; please try again.
Enter hours: fool
Input was not an integer, try again
The time is now 09:09:05p.m
Enter command(a,c,q,r,s,or t):q
BUILD SUCCESSFUL (total time: 5 minutes 11 seconds)
